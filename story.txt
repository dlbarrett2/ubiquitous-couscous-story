	John was quite old when he took the job at Dunkin Doughnuts.  78 to be exact.  He spent many nights sitting up wondering why he didn't choose another employer -- one that didn't have him start his shift at 5:30 in the morning.  But alas his work was what it was.  One day John was working when a man in a dark plaid sweater entered the store.
