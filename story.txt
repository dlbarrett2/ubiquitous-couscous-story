	John was quite old when he took the job at Dunkin Doughnuts.  78 to be exact.  He spent many nights sitting up wondering why he didn't choose another employer -- one that didn't have him start his shift at 5:30 in the morning.  But alas his work was what it was.  One day John was working when a man in a dark plaid sweater entered the store. That man asked him if he wants to change his life now or not. John was so depressed with his life right now, so he said yes. In turns out that man works for mafia organization. Therefore, now John works for it, he earn a ton of money now
Upon joining the mafia, things were finally starting to go John's way. Now, he could work a normal 9 to 5 shift, providing his family with ample food on the table and a roof over their heads. However, there was something about this new job that irked John. This wasn't just any mafia... it was the Krispy Kreme Crew. The arch nemesis of Dunkin Doughnuts!
John was fed up with Dunkin from his time there. One day he got his other mafia hanchos to overturn the Dunkin delivery truck.  After the job was done, the Dunkin store could not sustain itself after the massive loss and it was forced shutter its doors permanently.  John and the crew moved into the building, giving them a more permanent residence.
